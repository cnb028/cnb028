# ðŸ˜„Howdy Everyone!ðŸ˜„

My name is Christine, and I'm a junior Software Engineer and Web Developer!

I'm always open to new ideas, willing to learn, and am passionate about using tech to bridge the divide between humans of different backgrounds!

## ðŸ‘¾About MeðŸ‘¾
I was born and raised in Killeen, TX. I'm currently a couple of Semesters away from graduating with my Bachelor's Degree in Web Game Development! I hope to one day, get an amazing grasp of how to use AI to create Personal Assistants for Dimentia patients and those with disabilities similar to Dimentia. I would also like to learn a bit about robotics and be able to further assist those with Mobility Disabilties.
